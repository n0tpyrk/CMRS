# Project Overview
The Coffee Machine Reservation System (CMRS) was developed for the Gold Coast Coffee School, a barista training organisation. The systemâ€™s aim is to improve the efficiency of training baristas. The development team, the Gold Coast Coffee School (the client) and the barista students (the end-users) would be the three main parts of the stakeholders of this project.  According to the client, the commercial espresso machines used for training need a 20-minute pre-heating to be available for the barista students. Therefore, the students need to go to the venue at least 20 minutes earlier than the time they planned to practice. In addition, sometimes the students would also find the machines are all occupied when they arrive at the venue. To solve the problems, the CMRS allows barista students to reserve and turn on a coffee machine remotely by controlling the Internet of Things (IoT) sockets where the coffee machines are plugged in. Moreover, it also allows barista students to check the occupation status of the machines. The deliverables of this project would include the CMRS server implementation, a mobile app for barista students and coffee school staff, ESP8266-based IoT sockets for coffee machines, and the user manual.
